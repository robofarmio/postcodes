## Overview

[**Demo**](https://robofarmio.github.io/postcodes/)

![](./assets/postcodes.gif)

This project provides tools and algorithms to extract, prepare, and pre-compute German post code areas for prefix-based iterative lookups.
As an example, say the user enters the German post code "10247" for Berlin, Friedrichshain.

When the user enters
- "1" we already want to pan and zoom the map to the Berlin / Brandenburg zone
- "10" we already want to pan and zoom the map to the Berlin region
- "102" we already want to pan and zoom the map to the Friedrichshain area

These iterative prefix-based lookups require pre-computation to efficiently pan and zoom the map in an instant.

Note: our initial use case is German post codes, but it's possible to extend it to other prefix-based post code schemes.

## Usage

The following shows command line tools to process and work with the post code data.


### extract

To extract post codes from OpenStreetMap

    postcodes extract postcodes.geojson berlin-latest.osm.pbf

This will generate a `postcodes.geojson` file with
- one `MultiPolygon` feature per post code area
- a `postcode` property on each feature with the area's post code

### prepare

To prepare post code areas for lookup

    postcodes prepare bounds.geojson postcodes.geojson

This will generate a `bounds.geojson` file with
- one `Polygon` feature representing the area's bounds per post code feature
- a `postcode` property on each feature with the area's post code

### pyramid

To build a post code prefix search tree pyramid

    postcodes pyramid pyramid.geojson bounds.geojson

This will generate a `pyramid.geojson` file with
- one `Polygon` feature representing the area's bounds per post code prefix feature
- a `postcode` property on each feature with the area's post code prefix

We generate five prefix tree levels (German post codes are made up of five characters)
- the first level contains bounds for all post code areas starting with a single character
- the second level contains bounds for all post code areas starting with two character

and so on.

## Datasets

We recommend using OpenStreetMap snapshots provided by the lovely Geofabrik folks

    wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/berlin-latest.osm.pbf
